<br>
A young man who likes doing things no matter how pointless they are. Usually wears his standard clothing of black clothes with white collar (it's a white shirt underneath) and buttons (even while sleeping) and gloves.
Can get very attached to different people and friends, usually with the receiving end wanting nothing to do with him. However the friendships never seems to last long, and is back to being seen with just his dolls besides the family he lives with (Same thing with some certain dolls never being seen again).<br><br>
He sleeps in a coffin most of the time, and it greatly speeds up his state of healing because of the limit of light that's inside of it.<br>
<i>"Coffins are comfy."</i>-Randal<br>


<br>Because of his history of bad things and bad ends happening to those he interacts with, its best to avoid as much as possible or of becoming his next victim.<br>  
<br>He also tends to distort the truth and and what's real from what's not, since he enjoys causing chaos, so even these words might be distorted.<br>
<br>In fact its not a bad thing to become his friend. <img src="https://ranfren.neocities.org/art/smash.gif"><br>  
  
<b>POSSIBLE "FUTURE" GOALS:</b><img src="https://ranfren.neocities.org/profile/randal/Reaper%20(56).gif">AND TO MOVE THROUGH WALLS!!!!
